# Robocop_NodeJS_BBB_Irobot

This is a surveillance robot using Beaglebone and IRobot create, which uses a NodeJS server to connect to a sensor network deployed at home.

Piezo electric vibration sensors connected to doors and windows monitor the sensors and detect any attempt of breakin.
The web interface provides the user control over the entire system and webcam mounted on the IRobot provides visual feedback.

Whenever a break in attempt is informed by the sensor network the IRobot drives to that location, takes a picture and email the user.

The user can also drive the robot remotely using the remote drive feature via the web interface.

The demo video can be found in youtube here,
