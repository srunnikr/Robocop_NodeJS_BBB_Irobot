            <h3>Know the system</h3><br><br>
            	Your S2E surveillance system is designed to keep you safe and sound in your home. You can rest while our bot will look into any kind of unfriendly breach into your home and alert you of the same. Our robot continuously monitors your home gathering data from all of your window panes and doors, once you have activated the system and let you know if any disturbance is detected. The robot is smart enough to know where the disturbance is detected and it would navigate to the window/door, will take a picture and send you an email. You could configure any number of email addresses to notify. You can monitor the system status through the robot`s web server.
            </p>

            <p>
            	1. SYSTEM STATUS <br><br>
            	A GREEN circle in the system status denotes that the sensors are stable and you are safe now. <br>
            	It changes to RED when there is a window/door breach and the status message will change to ALERT. <br><br>

            	2. SEND ME A PIC <br><br>
            	You can use this button to get a picture as seen by the robot`s camera. <br><br>

            	3. SENSOR STATUS <br><br>
            	This indicates sensor status. A 'X' mark indicated that the sensors are not connected while a 'tick' mark indicates that sensors are connected and all set!. <br><br>

            	4. REMOTE DRIVE <br><br>
            	This nifty little feature will allow you to control the robot wirelessly through the webpage. You can move the robot forward, backward or turn left, right 90 degrees.
